The first thing we are going to find is the menu to be able to go to the following game options:

• Exit

## Part 1: Mini Game

Here we have the game. The objective is to catch all the squares, once the counter is at 12 we will go to the next scene where we will have to catch all the cylinders this time with a little more difficulty, using the jumps. Once the game is over, it will show us a game end screen.

## Part 2: Options

Here the game options will be shown to be able to play it.

## Part 3: Exit

The only thing this button does is exit the game.

## Part 4: Buttons

In all the scenes you will have two buttons, one for Exit and the other for Return to the Menu.
